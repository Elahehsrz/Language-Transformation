# Language Transformation 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing simple language transformation tasks using Python and state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) tools.

## Features

- Set up essential NLP tools using frameworks like PyTorch and Transformers.
- Implements language transformation logic, leveraging popular libraries like `langchain-cohere`.
- Visualizes results using `matplotlib`.
- Evaluates model performance using the `evaluate` library.

## Requirements

To use this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `transformers`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `evaluate`
  - `langchain-cohere`

The notebook installs these dependencies automatically.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Simple_language_transformation_code.ipynb
   ```
3. Run each cell sequentially to install dependencies, process data, and execute language transformations.

## Structure

1. **Setup**:
   - Installs the necessary libraries and frameworks.
2. **Model Initialization**:
   - Loads and initializes models for language transformation.
3. **Examples**:
   - Provides examples demonstrating language transformation.
